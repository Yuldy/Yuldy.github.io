    <p class="about-text">Hello there! I am from San Francisco, California and currently 
      a second-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine double majoring in <span>Computer Science 
        and Business Administration</span>. For career interests I am highly interested in Software Engineering as well as Product
      Management. In terms of my hobbies, I love working out and swimming during my free time as well as taking photos of my daily
      life.
